## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
- .NET 9.0 SDK
- NUnit Test Adapter
- In-memory database (Entity Framework)

### Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
dotnet test

# Run with coverage
dotnet test --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"

# Run specific test class
dotnet test --filter "ClassName=AuthServiceTests"

# Run tests with detailed output
dotnet test --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

### Test Configuration
- Uses in-memory database for isolation
- Each test gets a fresh database instance
- Proper setup and teardown for resources
- Mock external dependencies where needed

## Test Patterns Used

### Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA)
All tests follow the AAA pattern for clarity and consistency.

### Test Fixtures
- `[TestFixture]` for test classes
- `[SetUp]` and `[TearDown]` for test initialization
- Proper resource disposal

### Assertions
- NUnit constraint-based assertions
- Descriptive assertion messages
- Multiple assertions where appropriate

### Test Data
- Realistic test data
- Edge case coverage
- Boundary value testing

## Continuous Integration
These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with:
- Fast execution times
- No external dependencies
- Deterministic results
- Clear failure reporting

## Maintenance Notes
- Keep tests updated with code changes
- Add tests for new features
- Maintain test data consistency
- Regular test performance review
